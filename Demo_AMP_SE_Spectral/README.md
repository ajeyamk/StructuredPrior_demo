# The spiked matrix model with generative priors - Demonstration code 

## Requirements
    - Python >= 3.6
    - numpy, numpy, scipy, sklearn, pickle

## Summary
    We provide an implementation of AMP and its SE, LAMP and PCA and compare their reconstruction performance of the spike.

## Parameters 
    - non_linearity = ['linear','sign' , 'relu']
    - model = ['VV', 'UV']
    - k = system size
